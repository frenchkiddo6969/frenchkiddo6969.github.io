  <p><strong>if i do not have you friended on discord; ASK TO DM. how hard is it to understand?</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>if you DM me without asking i will ignore you or i will take forever to respond</strong></li>
    <li>
      <strong>if you ask about my age or any other PII</strong> when i don’t have you friended,
      <strong>i will also ignore you,</strong> and i most likely will block you because
      <strong>this is fucking creepy.</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>however</strong> if i see a question that is genuine about myself or my projects,
      you <strong>don’t need to ping me</strong> to DM and ask right away—<strong>but only if i allow DMs</strong> in the server we’re mutually in.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>you can only DM me if i agree</strong>—<u>ONLY AFTER you ping me and ASK to DM in a server</u>, <strong>NOT by DMing me on discord to ask for DMs.</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>I TREAT PEOPLE HOW THEY TREAT ME.</strong>—<u>if you treat me like an asshole then i will treat you like an asshole + loose trust with you. i play on logic and if that doesn't make you happy, sybau.
    </li>
  </ul>
