        <h1>ask to dm. please. at least if you don't have me friended on discord.</h1>
    </header>
    <h2>if i don't have you friended:</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>ping and ask me to DM, else i will completely ignore you. no buts.</li>
    <li>do not ask PII, and do not ask about my age should i not have you friended. i will IMMEDIATELY block you.</li>
    <li>expect me behaving the same way as you do, and if you don't like it, sybau and behave accordingly. i don't want to deal with toxic cunts that can't have a correct persona and instead relies on overstimulating me with garbage.</li>
    <li>remind yourself i have autism diagnosed, expect me being slightly wonky or repeating whatever same question a few times, or how i also stim with my favourite things.</li>
    <li>see me always in DND? that's to tune out annoyance being DM'd every 7 picoseconds. even on DND, i have an insane reaction time, so don't be scared! it's not always i'm busy anyways.</li>
    <li>i might be VERY suggestive at times. should you not like it, you should tell me immediately. minors beware.</li>
    <li>please tell me if i fuck up without noticing it instead of blocking me outright. i'm open to knowledge on how i can better myself should i fuck up so badly you reckon.</li>
</ul>
